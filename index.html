            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Our transdisciplinary research initiative focuses on improving Emergency Department (ED) workflows
                using cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to develop innovative solutions to
                reduce wait times, alleviate staff burnout, and enhance overall patient care in the ED.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Canadians rely extensively on Emergency Department (ED) care. 
                In fact, we have the highest rate of ED use among wealthy countries with universal health care.
                However, the emergency care experience in Canada is substandard.
                Often, the volume of patients seeking care outmatches the capacity to move patients through the ED, leading to overcrowding.
                This results in excessive wait times and patients leaving without seeing a physician.
                This delayed, or lack of, access to care results in poor patient experience and increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
                We have experienced steadily increasing wait times for patients to see a physician and lengths of stay in the ED over
                the past decade with no signs of improvement.
                Overcrowding in the ED has been referred to as the "canary in the coal mine" of the healthcare system.
                It is not just simply a function of the number of patients presenting to the ED (input),
                but also depends on ED throughput (length of stay in the ED), and the ability to move patients out of the ED through
                admission to in-patient units or safe discharge.

                <li><span class="font-semibold">High ED utilization rates:</span> 
                    Canada has the highest rate of ED use among wealthy countries with universal health care.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Inefficient patient throughput:</span>
                    The ED is a complex sociotechnical system involving interactions between human, social,
                    technical, and organizational factors all impacting throughput.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Physician and nurse burnout:</span> 
                    Physicians and nurses suffer from record burnout, with time spent on reading and charting
                    in Electronic Health Records (EHR) and paperwork.</li>
                 <li><span class="font-semibold">Challenges with Electronic Health Records (EHRs):</span>
                    Patients presenting to the ED are often unknown to clinicians.
                    This necessitates physicians spending a lengthy amount of time understanding patients' past medical history,
                    which takes precious time and requires immense cognitive load.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Our research aims to address these challenges by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li>Improve the summarization of patient charts, reducing physician workload.</li>
                <li>Develop agent-based simulations to model and optimize ED workflows.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
               We believe that these LLM-driven solutions can lead to more timely and accurate diagnoses,
               reduced burnout for healthcare providers, and ultimately, better patient outcomes.
